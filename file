 Web Application deployment with DevOps Tools.

Here is a summary of the project.

 I built a simple web application, using Docker and configured the infrastructure with Terraform. 
 Used Git for version control and moved the application to Azure. 
 Additionally, I implemented a fully functional DevOps pipeline that allowed us to easily develop, deploy, and manage web applications.
